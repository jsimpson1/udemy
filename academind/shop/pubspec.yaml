  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/512px-Trousers,_dress_(AM_1960.022-8).jpg
    - assets/images/1024px-Cast-Iron-Pan.jpg
    - assets/images/4438260868_cc79b3369d_z.jpg
    - assets/images/red-t-shirt-1710578_1280.jpg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Lato
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Lato-Regular.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Lato-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700
    - family: Anton
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Anton-Regular.ttf
  #
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
  # see https://flutter.dev/custom-fonts/#from-packages
